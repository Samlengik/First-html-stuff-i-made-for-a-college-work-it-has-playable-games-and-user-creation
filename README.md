# First-html-stuff-i-made-for-a-college-work-it-has-playable-games-and-user-creation

it's based on 70s, 80s arcades and gameboys. rn it only has 3 really basic games, being SNAKE game, PONG and SUPER SPACE INVADERS. but i think about investing on it when i have more time, and make more games.
it really have a basic user creation that doesn't require an emaail and it's more to save your scores and your username will appear on the main ranking. 
it was kinda rushy bc i have a time consuming job with kids and other stuff to do, so i used AI... but i edited most of the code and since claude it's not for free i had to figure out a lot of stuff by myself. i only had one week to do it and i thought it would be a lot harder.

btw i'm a computer science student, i made not only as a college homework but also bc i was missing a lot of games i used to play in my childhood with my first videogames and gameboys, so it was more like to pass time, which means i liked it a lot and i'm going to invest on it, now not relying much on AI and in a more calm pace. i just need to make it public acess.

and i'm only posting this here on github to build my portfolio.
